            <strong><p>Our group during this project consists of Juju Swaanen, Rayel Nabie, Simon Sorber and Thom Groenenberg.
              Most our work has been done at school and during school hours, but some tasks also fell outside of this planning. 
              Starting from sprint 2, and now in sprint 3, we have been actively working together as a team on this project for CLE 1.
              While doing so we kept an informal touch to our workstyle, whilst addressing any issues or points of concern in a more formal manner. 
              We also tended to work close to eachother by staying around the same table when possible. 
              All in all, this created an environment for us that has been both fun and productive.
