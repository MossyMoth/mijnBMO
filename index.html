      Our little robot, BMO, from Adventure Time <br>decided 
      to move to The Netherlands from the land of Ooo.<br> 
      Once he arrived, we helped him to find a new use for in your day-to-day lives.

    <strong>
      <p>Our team received the task to make a robot that will help people with their daily lives. 
        The first day-to-day problem we ran into was forgetting medication in the daily routine.
        The solution for this, that we gave to BMO, was a specialised pill dispenser. 
        This solves the issue of losing your medication,  
        and the alarm will help remind you to take your medication aswell.
      </p>
      <p>We also noticed teens and adolescents tend to feel lonely or bored every now and then.
        Because of this we have added a remote system which you can use to play some songs loaded onto BMO. 
        Now whenever you get bored, simply press a button and BMO will play a song.
      </p>
      <p>Next to that we gave BMO an alarm for when he falls.
        Cats or any other pets can have a habit of knocking things over and if they end up eating the meds when they fall out, it won't do them any good.
        With this alarm, you can instantly hear what happened and run to go clean it up.
      </p>
